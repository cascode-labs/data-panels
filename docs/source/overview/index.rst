**Export Rich IC Simulation Measurement Reports from Cadence Maestro to Powerpoint**

DataPanels automates the documentation of simulations in Cadence Virtuoso.
It uses Python's graphical capabilities to create data panels which can
combine plots, tables, smith charts, pictures, text, and many other kinds of
data into a panel.  These panels are assembled into a report which can be
directly exported to a pptx slide deck, or xlsx workbook.  Each slide
documents a panel with the content containing a picture of the panel,
the title is the same as the panel title, and a take-away statement at the
bottom.  If a pdf is desired, the pptx can be saved to pdf within the
Power Point editor.
